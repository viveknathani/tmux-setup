# tmux-setup

`tmux` is great for development. You can create a pane for `vim` where you would normally edit your files. You could have a pane where you test your code, run your server, etc. You can have a pane to run your `git` commands. Unfortunately, there is no default way to save this pane structure. So you have to create this manually. And that sucks. This is bash script that creates a tmux session and sets all the aforementioned panes.

## run

```bash
$ ./tmux-setup.sh <NAME>
# NAME is the session name you would like to have.
```
